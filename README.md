**Arena: Respawn** is a custom gamemode for [Team Fortress 2](http://www.teamfortress.com). Like Arena mode, the primary objective is to kill the other team before they kill yours. Unlike Arena mode, players can be respawned mid-round if a teammate captures the central control point.

This simple rule change has proven to be an interesting addition to the Arena gamemode, as mentioned in the [Official Team Fortress 2 blog](http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=14487). If you'd like to try it out before installing, hop into a [server near you](http://steam.respawn.tf) and give it a spin.
